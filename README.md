# Steam Big Picture Desktop Environment

This project aims to create a TV friendly computer gaming experience, using the proprietary Steam client's Big Picture mode as the main user interface.

This is still a work-in-progress in its early stages. The codebase started as a fork of [ChimeraOS's gamescope session](https://github.com/ChimeraOS/gamescope-session).

## Compatibility

Fedora 38 is currently the only target of this project.

There are no plans to work on compatibility with other linux distributions while the project is still in its infancy.
